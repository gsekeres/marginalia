## Summary

This paper develops a microfounded model of knowledge creation through research, where researchers choose both which questions to investigate and how intensely to study them. The authors conceptualize knowledge as improving decision-making by providing precise conjectures about answers to questions, with answers to related questions being correlated (modeled via Brownian motion). The key insight is that the benefits of discoveries are nonmonotone in novelty—questions that are too close to existing knowledge provide little new information, while questions too far away generate imprecise spillovers. The paper shows that myopic researchers tend to work on questions that are insufficiently novel, and demonstrates that "moonshots"—research on questions more novel than myopically optimal—can improve the long-run evolution of knowledge by inducing beneficial research cycles where subsequent researchers connect distant discoveries to existing knowledge.

## Key Contributions

- **Microfounded framework for knowledge value**: Develops a model where knowledge improves decision-making by providing conjectures about unanswered questions, with conjecture precision depending on distance from known answers
- **Nonmonotone benefits of novelty**: Shows that the benefits of discoveries peak at intermediate distances from existing knowledge, resolving a marginal-inframarginal trade-off between coverage and precision
- **Endogenous link between novelty and success probability**: Establishes that both the value and difficulty of discovery depend on a question's novelty, with researchers achieving higher output when "deepening" knowledge in areas of intermediate length
- **Dynamic externality of moonshots**: Demonstrates that discoveries far from existing knowledge, while suboptimal in the short run, can improve long-run knowledge evolution by guiding future researchers toward connecting distant findings
- **Ladder structure of knowledge expansion**: Shows that knowledge expands endogenously in a step-by-step structure, and characterizes when policy intervention through moonshot incentives is beneficial

## Methodology

The paper models questions as points on the real line with answers determined by a standard Brownian motion, capturing the intuition that answers to nearby questions are correlated. Knowledge consists of known question-answer pairs, and the decision-maker's conjecture about any unanswered question follows a normal distribution with mean and variance determined by the Brownian bridge properties. The value of knowledge is the integral over all questions of the decision-making improvement relative to an outside option, which depends on conjecture precision.

The researcher's problem involves choosing a question and a discovery probability, where the cost of achieving a given success probability scales with the variance of the initial conjecture (more novel questions are harder to answer). The authors characterize optimal research choices for arbitrary existing knowledge configurations and then extend to a dynamic setting where discoveries accumulate over time. They analyze policy interventions where a designer can direct one researcher's choices to improve the knowledge trajectory.

## Main Results

- **Benefits are maximized at intermediate distance**: Discoveries that "deepen" knowledge between distant (but not too distant) pieces of existing knowledge provide larger benefits than expanding beyond the frontier, unless all available areas are already short
- **Researchers choose insufficiently novel questions**: Myopically optimal research is too narrow and fails too often; researchers do not account for how their discoveries will guide future research
- **Knowledge evolves in a ladder structure**: If a researcher expands knowledge beyond the frontier, no future researcher will deepen that area—knowledge expansion proceeds step-by-step
- **Moonshots induce beneficial research cycles**: When a designer induces a moonshot discovery far from existing knowledge, subsequent researchers work to connect it to previous knowledge, increasing their output and pursuing more valuable questions
- **Policy effectiveness depends on patience and costs**: Moonshot incentives improve welfare when the designer is sufficiently patient and research costs are in an intermediate range
